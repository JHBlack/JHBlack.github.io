    <p> Hey Lauren, this is the start to my new website. How do you like it? Text me and let me know. I can't wait until
        the next
        time I see you
    </p>
        <p>I must confess, I have not been doing a good job abstaining from porn usage. It has been killer.
        The more I try to resist the more my brain wants it. This has to be the worst relapse I've had yet.
        I feel like I really can't control it. I am going to go back to therapy. I will also start attending
        Thursday church services to replenish my spiritual health. I am re-reading my book about pornography addiction
        again to help reinforce my resistence. The thing is I tried really hard to stay away from it but I started
        getting a bad stomach ache the more I resisted. It was not pleasant. I need so much help.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't think your help alone will solve my issue. At this point, God is the answer. I feel like I
        tried everything but it's not going well for me. That is why I must go back to church because I think som
        spiritual healing will help. I am just so sick in the brain. Its affecting me in every aspect of my life.
        I just want this gone.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you for being there for me. I couldn't do this without you. You really are the best. I can't wait until
        the next time I see you.
    </p>
